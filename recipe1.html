        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Braised rice, locally called Angwamo or oiled rice, is a staple food in Ghana that is often served with fried eggs, sardines, a red pepper sauce, and shito (a spicy black sauce made from dried fish and shrimp). <br><br>

            Angwamo is different from fried rice, where you cook the rice before frying it. In angwamo, you fry the rice with onions and salted beef in oil, then add water and cook until the rice is soft and fluffy. The frying process gives the rice a golden color, a sweet flavor, and a glossy sheen. The salted beef, also known as tolo beef or Ghana tolo beef, adds a musky and aromatic taste to the dish. You can also add vegetables, such as carrots, peas, or corn, to make it more nutritious.

                <ol>
                    <li>Wash the rice in a colander until the water runs clear, then drain and set aside.</li><br>
                    
                    <li>
                        In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and fry until golden brown, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Remove half of the onion and set aside for later.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        Add the salted beef and fry for another 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until crisp.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        Add the rice and fry for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to coat the rice with the oil and onion mixture.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        Add the water, the bouillon cube, and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed, for about 20 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork halfway through the cooking time.
                    </li><br>

                    <li>
                        Serve the rice hot, topped with the reserved fried onion. Enjoy with your choice of accompaniments, such as fried eggs, sardines, a red pepper sauce, and shito.
