        </div>

        <p>
            Jollof rice is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilis, onions, spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions. The dish originated in Senegal. <br><br>
            Regional variations are a source of competition among the countries of West Africa, and in particular between Nigeria and Ghana, over whose version is the best; in the 2010s this developed into a friendly rivalry known as the "Jollof Wars".

                <li>Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li><br>
                <li>Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.</li><br>
                <li>Heat the remaining ⅓ cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.</li><br>
                <li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.</li><br>
